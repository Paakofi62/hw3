#Encapsulation
encapsulations is when making a object private inside a class.No other defined object can call upon the object.
the object controls its functions and cannot be changed by other objects.
#Abstraction
abstractions hides the internal details of an object, it only shows the relevant operations to other odjects.
Absractions is like a remote, the remote shows the key buttons but inside the remote is the circuit board.
#Polymorphism
polymorphism allows a class to perform the same functions as its parent class. The class uses its parents methods
but now the class can add to it and add its own methods too.
#Inheritance
Inheritance is when you make a new class from an existing class.the new class has all the functions from the old 
class but can add to it. Its like parents having a child and the child inheriting their parents genes.
